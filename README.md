This is the backend service for the docreader guide platform.

## About

This project is a RESTful backend API for the docreader guide platform.
It is built using Node.js, Express and Prisma.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- `npm` >= 9.x
- `postgresql` running locally or remotely

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/asaber3030/nodejs-docreader-faculty
cd nodejs-docreader-faculty
npm install
```

### Set Up

Before running the service, you must first create the `.env` file and populate the necessary environment variables. Refer to [this section](#environment-variables) for details.

You must also make sure that you have a postgresql deployment running.

Run the following command to migrate the Prisma schema to it (after populating `DATABASE_URL` environment variable):

```
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### Running

```
npm run start
```

### Long-term Considerations

Consider creating a service script (for whatever init system your server distro uses) for the daemon, for better integration and management.

## Database Seeding Scripts

The `scripts` directory has some useful seeding scripts. Here's a description of each one:

1. `seedPermissions.js`: Seeds permissions for all action, scope and resource combinations.
2. `seedRoles.js`: Seeds the two default roles (`SuperAdmin` at id 0 and `User` at id 1) with expected (hard-coded) ids and appropriate permissions.
